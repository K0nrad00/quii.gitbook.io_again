# quii.gitbook.io_again
Tutorial of Go from https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/ .. again

## Topics to repeat (maybe from Mr. Mcleods videos):
- structs, methods and interfaces
- pointers  https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/go-fundamentals/pointers-and-errors
- try to understand 'assert' type of function, e.g. here: 
	- https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/go-fundamentals/pointers-and-errors#refactor-1 
	- https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/go-fundamentals/pointers-and-errors#refactor-2
	- https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/go-fundamentals/pointers-and-errors#write-the-test-first-3
- when we'd want to return 2 values in method, for example *string* and *error* like here:
https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/go-fundamentals/maps#write-the-test-first-1 and https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/go-fundamentals/maps#write-the-minimal-amount-of-code-for-the-test-to-run-and-check-the-output-1
- don't really get this:
https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/go-fundamentals/maps#write-the-test-first-3 till the end
 

## Other remarks:
- This is good error handling example and explanation why we sometimes need to 'return' from method: https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/go-fundamentals/pointers-and-errors#write-the-minimal-amount-of-code-for-the-test-to-run-and-check-the-failing-test-output-2
